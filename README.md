# CyberSecurity Strategy Analysis

This is an independently developed application to be submitted to the UN's Unite Ideas [CyberSecurityNLP initiative](https://cybersecuritynlp.uniteideas.spigit.com/Page/Home). The initiative is a collaborative project of [Unite Ideas](https://www.uniteideas.spigit.com/Page/Home), the Digital Blue Helmets, Fordham University, and Northeastern University.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a tool that expedites the review of national cybersecurity strategy documents. From the [project website](https://www.uniteideas.spigit.com/Page/Home):

> Analyzing strategy documents is a difficult task which requires human knowledge held by specialists in public policymaking, cybersecurity, legal, human resources, and other domains. It also involves lengthy manual reviewing and highlighting of documents in different formats. Let's expedite this effort.

## Data

The relevant documents to be analyzed are [here](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/National-Strategies-repository.aspx) and examples of human analyst summaries are [here](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/Country_Profiles.aspx). The documents are unstructured PDFs with varying structures.
